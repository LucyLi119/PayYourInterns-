      Reasons that interns deserve to be paid
      </h1>
      <p style="text-align:left;font-size:18px;color:white;">
        People should get paid for their work and it is common sense! <br> <br>

  Doing internships also costs money! As more and more full time employees are going back to their offices, interns are no exceptions. Commuting to an office whether by car or by public transport costs money. On top of that, eating out everyday for lunch and probably dinner can also get expensive since interns do not have access to their kitchen at work and probably do not have time to meal-prep either. It makes sense that these extra fees from doing an internship should at least be covered.

  <br> <br>Interns bring in new and fresh perspectives: Ok, let’s face it, most interns are very young and they are basically every company’s targeted audience. By hiring them, companies could also potentially benefit from learning about the latest trend, what young people are doing on the internet and what the hottest products on the market are. Knowing their TA’s behavior is crucial for a lot of companies and companies can gain more insights of their targeted audience’s behavior from their young interns.

  <br> <br>Most interns do not have sugar mommy/daddy (from what I know, I could be wrong tho) So who do these companies expect them to get money from? Their real daddy and mommy? Most of us do not come from money and even if we are, as adults we want to be as financially independent from our parents as possible. Also, listen, why the fuck do you expect my parents to pay for the work that I did for you?

  <br> <br>Paid interns are happy interns: when companies read this, they are probably going to be like: I give zero fuck about my interns’ happniess. If you don’t, then you should. Happy employees mean better and more efficient work. Interns know they are not going to be in the company for a very long time so if you want them to give it 100 percent, paying them might be one of the best ways.

  <br><br>IT IS FUCKING ILLEGAL to not pay your interns. Most companies probably have no idea. To be honest, me either! but apparently it is true. Go check out DianaWang’s case against Harper Bazaar
  and Lucy Bickerton’s case against Charlie Rose, in which she won a 250,000 dollar settlement.

        Why companies are not paying their interns
        </h1>
        <p style="text-align:left;font-size:18px;color:white;">
          First and foremost: it has always been like that. Starting from the 1960s, medical students without a license are called “interns” since then the term has been used more broadly and now any students who are working in a company while still enrolled in school are called interns. The tradition of not paying interns is hard to change but the good news is that unpaid internship positions are reducing in recent years globally. And in the US alone, unpaid internships have dropped from 50 percent in 2012 to 43 percent in 2017. So don’t be too sad! Changes are happening!!

<br> <br>Money! Money! Money! This one is pretty obvious and we all know that some companies hire interns so that they do not need to hire entry-level workers which will cost them way more money. While I completely understand the mentality behind it, it still does not make it ok for companies to not pay their interns at all. Many companies are not doing well financially after covid hits, but so are many of us! Companies are complaining about being broke but in reality they still have way more money than us students (duh).

<br> <br>Interns are royal workers who are also desperate: If you have ever tried to look for an internship, you know how difficult it is to get one. The spaces are very limited and a lot of companies are not even hiring interns. Many students, especially juniors and seniors have gone through the anxiety of not having an internship while their peers all get one. They are DESPERATE and the chances are they will say yes to whatever opportunities that they get. Interns are mostly very grateful for the opportunities that they get and they are more likely to work hard and even overwork without getting compensated. During tough times, they will even think twice before they finally decide to quit. (story of my life)

            The History of Internships
            </h1>
            <p style="text-align:left;font-size:18px;color:white;">
              You might be wondering, how did internships even become a thing? Well, the idea of having a training position that is different from the regular ones has been around for hundreds if not thousands of years. In ancient times, young people would learn a craft from an expert by helping and watching them do their work and this was called “apprenticeship” in which case, food and boarding are also provided (Some companies are so heartless these days just look at what their ancestors did!) Internship became a thing in the 1960s and back then “intern” was a fancy name only for unlicensed medical students who worked in hospitals. The key change occurred in the 70s when there were more students graduating from college than ever before. Employers started looking at this thing that is known today as “resume” and the labor market became more competitive than ever. Therefore, internships became a positive step forward to help graduates stand out from the crowd.

  <br> <br>Fast forward to today, doing an internship during college is not anything new and has somehow become a requirement in many cases. Students are more stressed out than ever because not only do they have to worry about their school work, they also have to worry about finding an internship and balancing between their work life and school life.
